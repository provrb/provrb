16-year-old programmer with 4+ years of experience, specializing in building clean, efficient, and impactful tools with a focus on functionality and security.

I'm proficient in C, C++, Python, Lua, and Go, with some knowledge in MATLAB and currently learning Rust. Using these languages I’ve developed a variety of projects, libraries and proof-of-concepts ranging from penetration testing tools to secure systems leveraging encryption techniques like AES and RSA.

I’m passionate about writing code that not only works but is also well-structured and visually appealing. My projects reflect a commitment to solving complex problems while maintaining a modern and minimalist approach to development.
