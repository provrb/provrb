I'm a senior in high school and co-founder/CTO of TrailMixr, a startup building to optimize multi-day trail planning in Canadian Provincial Parks.

With over 4 years of programming experience, I specialize in systems and low-level development to build fast, secure, and efficient software. 
I primarily work in **Rust, C, and C++.**

I believe systems-level programming is the most important part of software development. As abstraction increases, low-level engineers ensure everything underneath remains secure, performant, and reliable. I aim to deeply understand and contribute to that foundation.

## ðŸ§  Languages I Use

- **Systems Programming**: `Rust`, `C`, `C++`
- **Scripting / Automation**: `Python`, `Go`, `Lua`
- **Web/Desktop Development**: `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Tauri`
- **Academic / Analytical**: `MATLAB`
